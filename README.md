# Air-Travel-Delay-Intelligence
In this project I have analysed historical airline flight data to identify key factors contributing to delays, including weather, carrier performance, airport congestion, and scheduling patterns. Built predictive models to forecast flight delays, enabling data-driven insights to improve operational efficiency and passenger experience.
