# Air-Travel-Delay-Intelligence
In this project I have analysed historical airline flight data to identify key factors contributing to delays, including weather, carrier performance, airport congestion, and scheduling patterns. Built predictive models to forecast flight delays, enabling data-driven insights to improve operational efficiency and passenger experience. 

There are 3 code files in this project:
1. Data-Cleaning-And-Preprocessing.ipynb contains the Data Cleaning piece where I've cleaned the data, preprocessed it and saved the clean file for analysis
2. data-analysis-and-visualizations.ipynb contains all the Data Analsyis and Visualizations. The final data saved will then be used for Machine Learning to predict delay time on future flights.
3. The final file - Machine Learning.ipynb contains the ML code.

This Project is still being worked upon.
